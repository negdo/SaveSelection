### How to use

Buttons ```Save Selection``` and ```Restore Selection``` are located at the bottom of Object Context Menu (shortcut: ```Right Mouse Button```) in object and edit mode.

Addon operates separately in **Object Mode** and **Edit mode**.

In **Object Mode** saving selection will store pointers to all selected objects and user will be able to restore last save.

In **Edit mode** saving selection will save Selection Mode (Vertices/Edges/Faces) and all selected Vertices/Edges/Faces. When restoring selection, selection mode will also be restored.
