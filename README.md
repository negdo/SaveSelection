# Save Selection



**Save Selection** is a Blender addon enabling users to save current selection of objects/faces/edges/vertices and restore it later.

### How to use

Buttons ```Save Selection``` and ```Restore Selection``` are located at the bottom of the Object Context Menu (shortcut: ```Right Mouse Button```)  in object and edit mode.

Addon operates separately in **Object Mode** and **Edit mode**.

In **Object Mode** saving selection will store pointers to all selected objects and users will be able to restore the last save.

In **Edit mode** saving selection will automatically save selection mode and all selected vertices, edges, or faces, depending on the mode. When restoring selection, along with stored geometry elements the selection mode will also be restored.
